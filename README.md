## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
* Node.js installed on your machine.
* PostgreSQL database.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iArchitSharma/movie-reservation-system.git
    cd movie-reservation-system
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** with your environment variables:

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

    Add the following variables:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password
    DB_NAME=movie_reservation
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

4. **Create the Database Manually**: Before running the app, you need to create the movie_reservation database manually in PostgreSQL since Sequelize only syncs tables and does not create the database itself.

    * Open your PostgreSQL terminal or a PostgreSQL client and run:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE movie_reservation;
        ```

5. **Sync database schema**: Since migrations are not being used, Sequelize will automatically sync your models to the database tables. Ensure your database is up and running, and run the app:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
